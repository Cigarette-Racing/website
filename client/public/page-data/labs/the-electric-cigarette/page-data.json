Each of the two powertrains had 6 compact permanent-magnet synchronous electric motors with a maximum power of 185 hp (138 kW) and maximum torque of 184 ft-lb (250 Nm) each; so the boat was provided a combined maximum output of 2,251 hp (1,656 kW) and maximum torque of 2,213 ft-lb (3,000 Nm).

These power electronics are needed to convert the direct current from the high-voltage battery into the three-phase alternating current, which is required for the synchronous motors.  The inverters are individually controlled by the high-performance AMG-Powertrain-Controller (APC). Each powertrain side used 6 high-voltage batteries, connected in parallel.  With the electric connection in the Power Distribution Unit (PDU) an even energetic load distribution and symmetric discharge were guaranteed.  The high-voltage battery in the SLS AMG Coupé Electric Drive boasted an energy content of 60 kWh.  Cigarette and AMG multiplied this by four to 240 kWh!
